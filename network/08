Step 1.

	first you need to get the websites ip address. you can use nslookup command to do that. Exammple

		nslookup slash16.org

Printing will be something as below:

Server:		10.51.1.253
Address:	10.51.1.253#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	slash16.org
Address: 13.33.242.162
Name:	slash16.org
Address: 13.33.242.74
Name:	slash16.org
Address: 13.33.242.215
Name:	slash16.org
Address: 13.33.242.31

Step 2.

	You need to check information about the server by using whois command. Example:

	whois 13.33.242.162 | grep "Organization" | head -n 1 | sed s/"Organization   "//g

whois command gives alot information about the service. In that info there is section called Organization.

1. We will use grep to show only the lines that include the word "Organization".
2. After that we will use the command: head with flag -n 1 to get only the first line.
3. We use command sed to replace string: "Organization   " with nothing.

The print will be

Amazon Technologies Inc. (AT-88-Z)
